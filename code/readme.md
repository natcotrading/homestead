## What's this folder for?

The code folder houses the repositories for atlas and/or insiderapi. Place your atlas and/or insiderapi repositories inside this folder to have them automatically mapped into your Homestead VM. Besides this readme and the .gitignore, this folder should remain empty inside the repo.

Each repo you wish to work with in homestead will require an environment file (.env) to be added, as well as a `composer install`.
